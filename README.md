# semantic html assigment
assignment for foocoding's applicants.   

## Background
HTML in its pure form is a markup language that is only concerned about the appearance 
and structure of its content. By using semantic HTML the web page gets meaning and the tags
a description of what they should be used for. This results in same advantages:
-   search engines can gather better information about what your side is about and 
because of that improve the search results
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- It simply improves the readability of the code

## Assigment
1. Clone the repository via git or download the project as zip (green button 'clone or download')
2. Find the **index.html** file and open it in a browser and your favorite editor.
3. Replace as many meaningless tags in the html with their semantic equivalents. 
Make sure that your changes don't affect the appearance in the browser. 
Same semantic HTML elements come with built-in stylesheets, so you might be able 
to delete css definitions in the **main.css** file.
4. When you're done, send us your **index.html** and **main.css** file to this **[address]()**
